After enabling auto token sweeping, you can pause or resume the sweeping functionality at any time. When facing urgent situations (such as a need to temporarily freeze fund flows, handle risk events, or perform system checks), you can use "one-click pause" to quickly stop the automatic initiation of subsequent sweep transactions. After the risk is resolved, you can use "one-click resume" to restore sweeping.

## Feature description

- **Pause sweeping**: The system will stop automatically creating new sweep tasks/sweep transactions for the wallet (i.e., "will no longer automatically initiate sweep transactions").
- **Resume sweeping**: The system will resume executing the sweep logic according to the current sweep strategy.

> Note: Pause/Resume only affects the "automatically triggered" sweep behavior going forward. It does not affect sweep transactions that have already been initiated or completed.

## Prerequisites

- You have been assigned the [user role](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) of Operator, Manager, or Admin.
- You have [enabled auto token sweeping](/en/portal/enable-auto-sweep) for the wallet.
